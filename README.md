Hello, Dr. PÃ¡ez! 

Welcome to my final assignment. In the FinalAssignment_O3I folder you will find the .pdf file containing an adaptation to ACS format of the article published in the journal Metabolites (Metabolites 2023, 13, 1071. https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo13101071), which includes the most important results of the study prior to my thesis, in which it was evaluated whether some of the metabolites present in urine can be used to non-invasively monitor the Omega3-index. Although the adaptation to the format was done by me, the work is not my authorship, since I do not yet have my own results.

Thank you for all your support during this term! 

Happy holidays :)
Mariana
