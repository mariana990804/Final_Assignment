	abstract = {Long chain fatty acids influence inflammation through a variety of mechanisms; many of these are mediated by, or at least associated with, changes in fatty acid composition of cell membranes. Changes in these compositions can modify membrane fluidity, cell signaling leading to altered gene expression, and the pattern of lipid mediator production. Cell involved in the inflammatory response are typically rich in the n-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid, but the contents of arachidonic acid and of the n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can be altered through oral administration of EPA and DHA. Eicosanoids produced from arachidonic acid have roles in inflammation. EPA also gives rise to eicosanoids and these often have differing properties from those of arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids. EPA and DHA give rise to newly discovered resolvins which are anti-inflammatory and inflammation resolving. Increased membrane content of EPA and DHA (and decreased arachidonic acid content) results in a changed pattern of production of eicosanoids and resolvins. Changing the fatty acid composition of cells involved in the inflammatory response also affects production of peptide mediators of inflammation (adhesion molecules, cytokines etc.). Thus, the fatty acid composition of cells involved in the inflammatory response influences their function; the contents of arachidonic acid, EPA and DHA appear to be especially important. The anti-inflammatory effects of marine n-3 PUFAs suggest that they may be useful as therapeutic agents in disorders with an inflammatory component.},

[13C]ALNA excursion was greatest in cholesteryl ester (CE) (224 (SEM 70) μmol/l over 21 d) compared with triacylglycerol (9-fold), non-esterified fatty acids (37-fold) and phosphatidylcholine (PC, 7-fold). EPA excursion was similar in both PC (42 (SEM 8) μmol/l) and CE (42 (SEM 9) μmol/l) over 21 d. In contrast both [13C]DPA and [13C]DHA were detected predominately in PC (18 (SEM 4) and 27 (SEM 7) μmol/l over 21 d, respectively). Estimated net fractional ALNA inter-conversion was EPA 21 \%, DPA 6 \% and DHA 9 \%. Approximately 22 \% of administered [13C]ALNA was recovered as 13CO2 on breath over the first 24 h of the study. These results suggest differential partitioning of ALNA, EPA and DHA between plasma lipid classes, which may facilitate targeting of individual n−3 fatty acids to specific tissues. Comparison with previous studies suggests that women may possess a greater capacity for ALNA conversion than men. Such metabolic capacity may be important for meeting the demands of the fetus and neonate for DHA during pregnancy and lactation. Differences in DHA status between women both in the non-pregnant state and in pregnancy may reflect variations in metabolic capacity for DHA synthesis.},

	abstract = {There is considerable interest in the potential impact of several polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in mitigating the significant morbidity and mortality caused by degenerative diseases of the cardiovascular system and brain. Despite this interest, confusion surrounds the extent of conversion in humans of the parent PUFA, linoleic acid or α-linolenic acid (ALA), to their respective long-chain PUFA products. As a result, there is uncertainty about the potential benefits of ALA versus eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Some of the confusion arises because although mammals have the necessary enzymes to make the long-chain PUFA from the parent PUFA, in vivo studies in humans show that ≈5\% of ALA is converted to EPA and {\textless}0.5\% of ALA is converted to DHA. Because the capacity of this pathway is very low in healthy, nonvegetarian humans, even large amounts of dietary ALA have a negligible effect on plasma DHA, an effect paralleled in the ω6 PUFA by a negligible effect of dietary linoleic acid on plasma arachidonic acid. Despite this inefficient conversion, there are potential roles in human health for ALA and EPA that could be independent of their metabolism to DHA through the desaturation – chain elongation pathway.},

	abstract = {In order to assess nutritional adequacy, valid estimates of nutrient intake are required. One of the main errors in dietary assessment is misreporting. The objective was to review the extent, nature and determinants of misreporting in dietary assessment, how this affects reported intakes of micronutrients and how this is identified and measured, and to identify the best ways of dealing with misreporting when interpreting results. A systematic literature search was conducted for studies of misreporting of dietary intake in adults by 24 hour recalls or by estimated or weighed food records, published up to March 2008. Thirty-seven relevant studies were identified. Possible causes of misreporting were identified. Methods most used to identify misreporting were the Goldberg cut-off (46 \% studies) and the doubly labelled water technique (24 \% studies). The magnitude of misreporting of energy intake was similar in all three dietary assessment methods. The percentage of under-reporters was about 30 \% and energy intake was underestimated by approximately 15 \%. Seven papers presented usable data for micronutrient intake. Absolute intakes of Fe, Ca and vitamin C (the three micronutrients addressed in all papers) were on average 30 \% lower in low-energy reporters (LER) than that in non-LER and, although results were not consistent, there was a tendency for micronutrient density to be higher in LER. Excluding underreporters or using energy adjustment methods for micronutrient intakes is discussed. Residual method of energy adjustment seems to be a good tool for practice to decrease an influence of misreporting when interpreting results of studies based on food records and 24 hour recalls.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess relationships between the fatty acid contents of plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids and those in liver, heart, brain, kidney and quadriceps muscle in rats. To obtain a wide range of tissue omega-3 (n-3) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) we subjected weanling rats to dietary treatment with the n-3 LCPUFA precursor, alpha linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3 n-3) for 3 weeks. With the exception of the brain, we found strong and consistent correlations between the total n-3 LCPUFA fatty acid content of both plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids with fatty acid levels in all tissues. The relationships between eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5 n-3) content in both blood fractions with levels in liver, kidney, heart and quadriceps muscle phospholipids were stronger than those for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3). The strong correlations between the EPA+DHA (the Omega-3 Index), total n-3 LCPUFA and total n-3 PUFA contents in both plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids and tissues investigated in this study suggest that, under a wide range of n-3 LCPUFA values, plasma and erythrocyte n-3 fatty acid content reflect not only dietary PUFA intakes but also accumulation of endogenously synthesised n-3 LCPUFA, and thus can be used as a reliable surrogate for assessing n-3 status in key peripheral tissues.},

	abstract = {Background. Low intakes or blood levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA + DHA) are independently associated with increased risk of death from coronary heart disease (CHD). In randomized secondary prevention trials, fish or fish oil have been demonstrated to reduce total and CHD mortality at intakes of about 1 g/day. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid (FA) composition reflects long-term intake of EPA + DHA. We propose that the RBC EPA + DHA (hereafter called the Omega-3 Index) be considered a new risk factor for death from CHD. Methods. We conducted clinical and laboratory experiments to generate data necessary for the validation of the Omega-3 Index as a CHD risk predictor. The relationship between this putative marker and risk for CHD death, especially sudden cardiac death (SCD), was then evaluated in several published primary and secondary prevention studies. Results. The Omega-3 Index was inversely associated with risk for CHD mortality. An Omega-3 Index of ≥8\% was associated with the greatest cardioprotection, whereas an index of ≤4\% was associated with the least. Conclusion. The Omega-3 Index may represent a novel, physiologically relevant, easily modified, independent, and graded risk factor for death from CHD that could have significant clinical utility.},

	abstract = {Needle fear typically begins in childhood and represents an important health-related issue across the lifespan. Individuals who are highly fearful of needles frequently avoid health care. Although guidance exists for managing needle pain and fear during procedures, the most highly fearful may refuse or abstain from such procedures. The purpose of a clinical practice guideline (CPG) is to provide actionable instruction on the management of a particular health concern; this guidance emerges from a systematic process. Using evidence from a rigorous systematic review interpreted by an expert panel, this CPG provides recommendations on exposure-based interventions for high levels of needle fear in children and adults. The AGREE-II, GRADE, and Cochrane methodologies were used. Exposure-based interventions were included. The included evidence was very low quality on average. Strong recommendations include the following. In vivo (live/in person) exposure-based therapy is recommended (vs. no treatment) for children seven years and older and adults with high levels of needle fear. Non-in vivo (imaginal, computer-based) exposure (vs. no treatment) is recommended for individuals (over seven years of age) who are unwilling to undergo in vivo exposure. Although there were no included trials which examined children {\textless} 7 years, exposure-based interventions are discussed as good clinical practice. Implementation considerations are discussed and clinical tools are provided. Utilization of these recommended practices may lead to improved health outcomes due to better health care compliance. Research on the understanding and treatment of high levels of needle fear is urgently needed; specific recommendations are provided.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in metabolomics allow for more objective assessment of contemporary food exposures, which have been proposed as an alternative or complement to self-reporting of food intake. However, the quality of evidence supporting the utility of dietary biomarkers as valid measures of habitual intake of foods or complex dietary patterns in diverse populations has not been systematically evaluated. We reviewed nutritional metabolomics studies reporting metabolites associated with specific foods or food groups; evaluated the interstudy repeatability of dietary biomarker candidates; and reported study design, metabolomic approach, analytical technique(s), and type of biofluid analyzed. A comprehensive literature search of 5 databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, BIOSIS, and CINAHL) was conducted from inception through December 2020. This review included 244 studies, 169 (69\%) of which were interventional studies (9 of these were replicated in free-living participants) and 151 (62\%) of which measured the metabolomic profile of serum and/or plasma. Food-based metabolites identified in ≥1 study and/or biofluid were associated with 11 food-specific categories or dietary patterns: 1) fruits; 2) vegetables; 3) high-fiber foods (grain-rich); 4) meats; 5) seafood; 6) pulses, legumes, and nuts; 7) alcohol; 8) caffeinated beverages, teas, and cocoas; 9) dairy and soya; 10) sweet and sugary foods; and 11) complex dietary patterns and other foods. We conclude that 69 metabolites represent good candidate biomarkers of food intake. Quantitative measurement of these metabolites will advance our understanding of the relation between diet and chronic disease risk and support evidence-based dietary guidelines for global health.},

	abstract = {Background: Omega-3 (n–3) fatty acid (FA) consumption is thought to improve depressive symptoms. However, current evidence is limited, and whether this association exists among Puerto Ricans, a population burdened by depression, remains uncertain. Objectives: We examined the association between ω-3 FA biomarkers and depressive symptoms as well as the potential influence of oxidative stress. Methods: Baseline and longitudinal analyses were conducted in the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (n = 787; participants aged 57 ± 0.52 y, 73\% women). Urinary 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) concentration, a measure of oxidative stress, and erythrocyte FA composition were collected at baseline. We calculated the omega-3 index as the sum of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, expressed as a percentage of total FAs. Baseline and 2-y depressive symptoms were characterized by using the Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression Scale (CES-D). Statistical analyses included linear and logistic regression. Results: Urinary 8-OHdG concentration tended to modify the relation between the erythrocyte omega-3 index and baseline CES-D score (P-interaction = 0.10). In stratified analyses, the omega-3 index was inversely associated with CES-D score (β = −1.74, SE = 0.88; P = 0.02) among those in the top quartile of 8-OHdG concentration but not among those in the lower quartiles. The relation between the omega-3 index and CES-D at 2 y was more clearly modified by 8-OHdG concentration (P-interaction = 0.04), where the omega-3 index was inversely associated with CES-D at 2 y, adjusted for baseline (β = −1.66, SE = 0.66; P = 0.02), only among those with elevated 8-OHdG concentrations. Among individuals not taking antidepressant medications and in the top tertile of urinary 8-OHdG concentration, the omega-3 index was associated with significantly lower odds of a CES-D score ≥16 at baseline (OR: 0.72; 95\% CI: 0.53, 0.96) but not at 2 y (OR: 0.83; 95\% CI: 0.60, 1.15). Conclusions: An inverse association between the omega-3 index and depressive symptoms was observed among participants with elevated oxidative stress biomarkers. These data suggest that oxidative stress status may identify those who might benefit from ω-3 FA consumption to improve depressive symptoms.},

	abstract = {Background
Results from observational studies regarding associations between fish (including shellfish) intake and cardiovascular disease risk factors, including blood pressure (BP) and BMI, are inconsistent.
Objective
To investigate associations of fish consumption and associated urinary metabolites with BP and BMI in free-living populations.
Methods
We used cross-sectional data from the International Study of Macro-/Micronutrients and Blood Pressure (INTERMAP), including 4680 men and women (40–59 y) from Japan, China, the United Kingdom, and United States. Dietary intakes were assessed by four 24-h dietary recalls and BP from 8 measurements. Urinary metabolites (2 timed 24-h urinary samples) associated with fish intake acquired from NMR spectroscopy were identified. Linear models were used to estimate BP and BMI differences across categories of intake and per 2 SD higher intake of fish and its biomarkers.
Results
No significant associations were observed between fish intake and BP. There was a direct association with fish intake and BMI in the Japanese population sample (P trend = 0.03; fully adjusted model). In Japan, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and taurine, respectively, demonstrated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.81 and 0.78 in discriminating high against low fish intake, whereas homarine (a metabolite found in shellfish muscle) demonstrated an AUC of 0.80 for high/nonshellfish intake. Direct associations were observed between urinary TMAO and BMI for all regions except Japan (P {\textless} 0.0001) and in Western populations between TMAO and BP (diastolic blood pressure: mean difference 1.28; 95\% CI: 0.55, 2.02 mmHg; P = 0.0006, systolic blood pressure: mean difference 1.67; 95\% CI: 0.60, 2.73 mmHg; P = 0.002).
Conclusions
Urinary TMAO showed a stronger association with fish intake in the Japanese compared with the Western population sample. Urinary TMAO was directly associated with BP in the Western but not the Japanese population sample. Associations between fish intake and its biomarkers and downstream associations with BP/BMI appear to be context specific. INTERMAP is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00005271.},

	abstract = {Supplementation with monounsaturated or ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) can lower resting blood pressure (BP) and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. The independent contributions of the n-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on BP, and the mechanisms responsible, are unclear. We tested whether EPA, DHA, and olive oil (OO), a source of monounsaturated fat, differentially affect resting hemodynamics and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). Eighty-six healthy young men and women were recruited to participate in a 12-wk, randomized, double-blind trial examining the effects of orally supplementing {\textasciitilde}3 g/day of EPA (n = 28), DHA (n = 28), or OO (n = 30) on resting hemodynamics; MSNA was examined in a subset of participants (n = 31). Both EPA and DHA supplements increased the ω-3 index (P {\textless} 0.01). Reductions in systolic BP were greater [adjusted intergroup mean difference (95\% confidence interval)] after DHA [−3.4 mmHg (−0.9, −5.9), P = 0.008] and OO [−3.0 mmHg (−0.5, −5.4), P = 0.01] compared with EPA, with no difference between DHA and OO (P = 0.74). Reductions in diastolic BP were greater following DHA [−3.4 mmHg (−1.3,−5.6), P = 0.002] and OO [−2.2 mmHg (0.08,−4.3), P = 0.04] compared with EPA. EPA increased heart rate compared with DHA [4.2 beats/min (−0.009, 8.4), P = 0.05] and OO [4.2 beats/min, (0.08, 8.3), P = 0.04]. MSNA burst frequency was higher after DHA [4 bursts/min (0.5, 8.3), P = 0.02] but not OO [−3 bursts/min (−6, 0.6), P = 0.2] compared with EPA. Overall, DHA and OO evoked similar responses in resting BP; however, DHA, but not OO, increased peripheral vasoconstrictor outflow. These findings may have implications for fatty acid supplementation in clinical populations characterized by chronic high BP and sympathetic overactivation.

NEW \& NOTEWORTHY We studied the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and olive oil supplementation on blood pressure (BP) and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). After 12 wk of 3 g/day supplementation, DHA and olive oil were associated with lower resting systolic and diastolic BPs than EPA. However, DHA increased MSNA compared with EPA. The reductions in BP with DHA likely occur via a vascular mechanism and evoke a baroreflex-mediated increase in sympathetic activity.},

	abstract = {Background
It has long been believed that DHA supplementation increases plasma EPA via the retroconversion pathway in mammals. However, in rodents this increase in EPA is likely due to a slower metabolism of EPA, but this has never been tested directly in humans.
Objective
The aim of this study was to use the natural variations in 13C:12C ratio (carbon-13 isotopic abundance [δ13C]) of n–3 PUFA supplements to assess n–3 PUFA metabolism following DHA or EPA supplementation in humans.
Methods
Participants (aged 21.6 ± 2.2 y) were randomly assigned into 1 of 3 supplement groups for 12 wk: 1) olive oil control, 2) ∼3 g/d DHA, or 3) ∼3 g/d EPA. Blood was collected before and after the supplementation period, and concentrations and δ13C of plasma n–3 PUFA were determined.
Results
DHA supplementation increased (P {\textless} 0.05) plasma EPA concentrations by 130\% but did not affect plasma δ13C-EPA (−31.0 ± 0.30 to −30.8 ± 0.19, milliUrey ± SEM, P {\textgreater} 0.05). In addition, EPA supplementation did not change plasma DHA concentrations (P {\textgreater} 0.05) but did increase plasma δ13C-DHA (−27.9 ± 0.2 to −25.6 ± 0.1, P {\textless} 0.05) toward δ13C-EPA of the supplement (−23.5 ± 0.22). EPA supplementation increased plasma concentrations of EPA and docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn–3) by 880\% and 200\%, respectively, and increased plasma δ13C-EPA (−31.5 ± 0.2 to −25.7 ± 0.2) and δ13C-DPAn–3 (−28.9 ± 0.3 to −25.0 ± 0.1) toward δ13C-EPA of the supplement.
Conclusions
In this study, we show that the increase in plasma EPA following DHA supplementation in humans does not occur via retroconversion, but instead from a slowed metabolism and/or accumulation of plasma EPA. Furthermore, substantial amounts of supplemental EPA can be converted into DHA. δ13C of n–3 PUFA in humans is a powerful and underutilized tool that can track dietary n–3 PUFA and elucidate complex metabolic questions.

	abstract = {Rates of pediatric Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are increasing globally. Differentiation of these inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subtypes however can be challenging when relying on invasive endoscopic approaches. We sought to identify urinary metabolic signatures of pediatric IBD at diagnosis, and during induction treatment. Nontargeted metabolite profiling of urine samples from CD (n = 18) and UC (n = 8) in a pediatric retrospective cohort study was performed using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Over 122 urinary metabolites were reliably measured from pediatric IBD patients, and unknown metabolites were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Dynamic changes in sum-normalized urinary metabolites were also monitored following exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) or corticosteroid therapy (CS) in repeat urine samples collected over 8 weeks. Higher urinary excretion of indoxyl sulfate, hydroxyindoxyl sulfate, phenylacetylglutamine, and sialic acid were measured in CD as compared to UC patients, but lower threonine, serine, kynurenine, and hypoxanthine (p {\textless} 0.05). Excellent discrimination of CD from UC was achieved based on the urinary serine:indoxylsulfate ratio (AUC = 0.972; p = 3.21 × 10−5). Urinary octanoyl glucuronide, pantothenic acid, and pyridoxic acid were also identified as specific dietary biomarkers of EEN in pediatric IBD patients who achieved clinical remission. This work may complement or replace existing strategies in the diagnosis and early management of children with IBD.},

	abstract = {The sweat chloride test remains the gold standard for confirmatory diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) in support of universal newborn screening programs. However, it provides ambiguous results for intermediate sweat chloride cases while not reflecting disease progression when classifying the complex CF disease spectrum given the pleiotropic effects of gene modifiers and environment. Herein we report the first characterization of the sweat metabolome from screen-positive CF infants and identify metabolites associated with disease status that complement sweat chloride testing. Pilocarpine-stimulated sweat specimens were collected independently from two CF clinics, including 50 unaffected infants (e.g., carriers) and 18 confirmed CF cases. Nontargeted metabolite profiling was performed using multisegment injection–capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry as a high throughput platform for analysis of polar/ionic metabolites in volume-restricted sweat samples. Amino acids, organic acids, amino acid derivatives, dipeptides, purine derivatives, and unknown exogenous compounds were identified in sweat when using high resolution tandem mass spectrometry, including metabolites associated with affected yet asymptomatic CF infants, such as asparagine and glutamine. Unexpectedly, a metabolite of pilocarpine, used to stimulate sweat secretion, pilocarpic acid, and a plasticizer metabolite from environmental exposure, mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalic acid, were secreted in the sweat of CF infants at significantly lower concentrations relative to unaffected CF screen-positive controls. These results indicated a deficiency in human paraoxonase, an enzyme unrelated to mutations to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and impaired chloride transport, which is a nonspecific arylesterase/lactonase known to mediate inflammation, bacterial biofilm formation, and recurrent lung infections in affected CF children later in life. This work sheds new light into the underlying mechanisms of CF pathophysiology as required for new advances in precision medicine of orphan diseases that benefit from early detection and intervention, including new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.},

Over the past 15 years, the HMDB has grown and evolved significantly to meet the needs of the metabolomics community and respond to continuing changes in internet and computing technology. This year's update, HMDB 5.0, brings a number of important improvements and upgrades to the database. These should make the HMDB more useful and more appealing to a larger cross-section of users. In particular, these improvements include: (i) a significant increase in the number of metabolite entries (from 114 100 to 217 920 compounds); (ii) enhancements to the quality and depth of metabolite descriptions; (iii) the addition of new structure, spectral and pathway visualization tools; (iv) the inclusion of many new and much more accurately predicted spectral data sets, including predicted NMR spectra, more accurately predicted MS spectra, predicted retention indices and predicted collision cross section data and (v) enhancements to the HMDB’s search functions to facilitate better compound identification. Many other minor improvements and updates to the content, the interface, and general performance of the HMDB website have also been made. Overall, we believe these upgrades and updates should greatly enhance the HMDB’s ease of use and its potential applications not only in human metabolomics but also in exposomics, lipidomics, nutritional science, biochemistry and clinical chemistry.},

	abstract = {The CFM-ID 4.0 web server (https://cfmid.wishartlab.com) is an online tool for predicting, annotating and interpreting tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra of small molecules. It is specifically designed to assist researchers pursuing studies in metabolomics, exposomics and analytical chemistry. More specifically, CFM-ID 4.0 supports the: 1) prediction of electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectra (ESI-QTOF-MS/MS) for small molecules over multiple collision energies (10 eV, 20 eV, and 40 eV); 2) annotation of ESI-QTOF-MS/MS spectra given the structure of the compound; and 3) identification of a small molecule that generated a given ESI-QTOF-MS/MS spectrum at one or more collision energies. The CFM-ID 4.0 web server makes use of a substantially improved MS fragmentation algorithm, a much larger database of experimental and in silico predicted MS/MS spectra and improved scoring methods to offer more accurate MS/MS spectral prediction and MS/MS-based compound identification. Compared to earlier versions of CFM-ID, this new version has an MS/MS spectral prediction performance that is ∼22\% better and a compound identification accuracy that is ∼35\% better on a standard (CASMI 2016) testing dataset. CFM-ID 4.0 also features a neutral loss function that allows users to identify similar or substituent compounds where no match can be found using CFM-ID’s regular MS/MS-to-compound identification utility. Finally, the CFM-ID 4.0 web server now offers a much more refined user interface that is easier to use, supports molecular formula identification (from MS/MS data), provides more interactively viewable data (including proposed fragment ion structures) and displays MS mirror plots for comparing predicted with observed MS/MS spectra. These improvements should make CFM-ID 4.0 much more useful to the community and should make small molecule identification much easier, faster, and more accurate.},

	abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomic initiatives that use conventional separation techniques are limited by low sample throughput and complicated data processing that contribute to false discoveries. Herein, we introduce a new strategy for unambiguous identification and accurate quantification of biomarkers for inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) from dried blood spots (DBS) with quality assurance. A multiplexed separation platform based on multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS) was developed to provide comparable sample throughput to flow injection analysis-tandem MS (FIA-MS/MS) but with greater selectivity as required for confirmatory testing and discovery-based metabolite profiling of volume-restricted biospecimens. Mass spectral information is encoded temporally within a separation by serial injection of three or more sample pairs, each having a unique dilution pattern, alongside a quality control (QC) that serves as a reference in every run to facilitate between-sample comparisons and/or batch correction due to system drift. Optimization of whole blood extraction conditions on DBS filter paper cut-outs was first achieved to maximize recovery of a wide range of polar metabolites from DBS extracts. An interlaboratory comparison study was also conducted using a proficiency test and retrospective neonatal DBS that demonstrated good agreement between MSI-CE-MS and validated FIA-MS/MS methods within an accredited facility. Our work demonstrated accurate identification of various IEM based on reliable measurement of a panel of primary or secondary biomarkers above an upper cutoff concentration limit for presumptive screen-positive cases without stable isotope-labeled reagents. Additionally, nontargeted metabolite profiling by MSI-CE-MS with temporal signal pattern recognition revealed new biomarkers for early detection of galactosemia, such as N-galactated amino acids, that are a novel class of pathognomonic marker due to galactose stress in affected neonates.},

	abstract = {Sarcopenia is the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength and function, which may be accelerated during periods of physical inactivity. Declines in skeletal muscle and functionality not only impacts mobility but also increases chronic disease risk, such as type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to measure adaptive metabolic responses to acute changes in habitual activity in a cohort of overweight, pre-diabetic older adults (age = 69 ± 4 years; BMI = 27 ± 4 kg/m2, n = 17) when using non-targeted metabolite profiling by multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Participants completed two weeks of step reduction ({\textless}1000 steps/day) followed by a two week recovery period, where fasting plasma samples were collected at three time intervals at baseline, after step reduction and following recovery. Two weeks of step reduction elicited increases in circulatory metabolites associated with a decline in muscle energy metabolism and protein degradation, including glutamine, carnitine and creatine (q {\textless} 0.05; effect size {\textgreater} 0.30), as well as methionine and deoxycarnitine (p {\textless} 0.05; effect size ≈ 0.20) as compared to baseline. Similarly, decreases in uremic toxins in plasma that promote muscle inflammation, indoxyl sulfate and hippuric acid, as well as oxoproline, a precursor used for intramuscular glutathione recycling, were also associated with physical inactivity (p {\textless} 0.05; effect size {\textgreater} 0.20). Our results indicate that older persons are susceptible to metabolic perturbations due to short-term step reduction that were not fully reversible with resumption of normal ambulatory activity over the same time period. These plasma biomarkers may enable early detection of inactivity-induced metabolic dysregulation in older persons at risk for sarcopenia not readily measured by current imaging techniques or muscle function tests, which is required for the design of therapeutic interventions to counter these deleterious changes in support of healthy ageing.},

A gradient ascent algorithm is proposed that allows to maximize the penalized log-likelihood yielding models with reduced complexity. In contrast to common procedures it can be used in high-dimensional settings where a large number of potentially influential explanatory variables is available.

	abstract = {Background
Comparative studies suggest that DHA may have stronger serum triglyceride–lowering effects than EPA; however, the molecular basis for this differential effect remains unexplored in humans. Differential regulation of lipogenesis and triglyceride clearance are 2 possible mechanisms of action.
Objectives
We compared the effects of EPA and DHA supplementation on serum triglycerides, markers of lipogenesis, and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in adults participating in a double-blind, multiarm, placebo-controlled parallel-group randomized trial. Lipogenesis was assessed with the lipogenic index and compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA).
Methods
Young, healthy normolipidemic men and women (n = 89; 21.6 ± 0.23 y; mean ± SEM) were randomly allocated into 1 of 3 supplement groups for 12 wk: 1) olive oil, 2) ∼3 g EPA/d, and 3) ∼3 g DHA/d. Omega-3 supplements were provided in triglyceride form. Blood was collected before and after supplementation for the analysis of fatty acids and preheparin LPL activity. Variations in the 13C:12C ratio (δ13C) of palmitate (16:0) and linoleate (18:2n–6) were measured by CSIA.
Results
DHA supplementation reduced blood triglycerides (0.85 ± 0.04 mmol/L to 0.65 ± 0.03 mmol/L; P {\textless} 0.01), with no change seen with EPA supplementation. DHA supplementation did not change the lipogenic index or δ13C-16:0, whereas EPA supplementation increased the lipogenic index by 11\% (P {\textless} 0.01) and δ13C-16:0 (P = 0.03) from −23.2 ± 0.2 to −22.8 ± 0.2 milliUrey ± SEM.
Conclusions
Reduced triglyceride concentrations after DHA supplementation are associated with increased LPL activity, whereas the null effect of EPA supplementation on blood triglycerides may stem from the concomitant increases in lipogenesis and LPL activity. Further investigation of the differential triglyceride-lowering effects of EPA and DHA is warranted in both normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic individuals. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03378232.},

	abstract = {Nutritional biomarkers are used for a variety of purposes in large-scale population surveys and epidemiologic studies as well as smaller clinical studies. The main reasons for using nutritional biomarkers are to provide measures of nutritional status that have less error than dietary data, nutrient status for nutrients with inadequate dietary data, to obtain a more proximal and integrated assessment of nutrient status that incorporates metabolism, to assess dietary change and compliance in intervention studies, and dietary intake for the validation of dietary questionnaires. However, often there is oversight by the investigators regarding biologic and laboratory issues, which have implications for the utility of nutritional biomarkers. This article reviews some of the physiologic issues that contribute to between-person variability in nutrient status and the utility and meaning of specimens from various body compartments. Issues related to the collection and storage of biologic specimens are addressed, although it is recommended that investigators contact laboratory colleagues at the beginning of any study for updated information. The necessity for blind quality surveillance of laboratory analyses beyond the normal procedures employed by collaborating laboratories also is addressed. The advantages and disadvantages of nutritional biomarkers are reviewed, especially in comparison with using dietary methodology. J. Nutr. 133: 875S–880S, 2003.},

	abstract = {Background
The erythrocyte membrane content of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which constitutes the omega‐3 index (O3I), predicts cardiovascular disease mortality. The amount of EPA+DHA needed to achieve a target O3I is poorly defined, as are the determinants of the O3I response to a change in EPA+DHA intake. The objective of this study was to develop a predictive model of the O3I response to EPA+DHA supplementation in healthy adults, specifically identifying factors that determine the response.
Methods and Results
A randomized, placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, parallel‐group study was conducted in 115 healthy men and women. One of 5 doses (0, 300, 600, 900, 1800 mg) of EPA+DHA was given daily as placebo or fish oil supplements for ≈5 months. The O3I was measured at baseline and at the end of the study. There were no significant differences in the clinical characteristics between the groups at baseline. The O3I increased in a dose‐dependent manner (P{\textless}0.0001), with the dose of EPA+DHA alone accounting for 68\% (quadratic, P{\textless}0.0001) of the variability in the O3I response. Dose adjusted per unit body weight (g/kg) accounted for 70\% (linear, P{\textless}0.0001). Additional factors that improved prediction of treatment response were baseline O3I, age, sex, and physical activity. Collectively, these explained 78\% of the response variability (P{\textless}0.0001).
Conclusions
Our findings validate the O3I as a biomarker of EPA+DHA consumption and identify additional factors, particularly body weight, that can be used to tailor EPA+DHA recommendations to achieve a target O3I.},

However, omega-3 index (O3I) determination is not routinely assessed due to complicated procedures for n3-LCPUFA analysis from the phospholipid (PL) fraction of erythrocytes. Herein, a high-throughput method for lipidomics based on multisegment injection-nonaqueous capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry was applied to identify circulating PLs as surrogate biomarkers of O3I in two randomized placebo-controlled trials. An untargeted lipidomic data workflow using a subgroup analysis of serum extracts from sunflower oil versus high-dose fish oil (FO)-supplemented participants revealed that ingested n3-LCPUFAs were primarily distributed as their phosphatidylcholines (PCs) relative to other PL classes. In both high-dose FO (5.0 g/day) and EPA-only trials (3.0 g/day), PC (16:0\_20:5) was the most responsive PL, whereas PC (16:0\_22:6) was selective to DHA-only supplementation. We also demonstrated that the sum concentration of both these PCs in fasting serum or plasma samples was positively correlated to the O3I following FO (\textit{r} = 0.708, \textit{P} = 1.02 × 10$^{\textrm{−11}}$, n = 69) and EPA- or DHA-only supplementation (\textit{r} = 0.768, \textit{P} = 1.01 × 10$^{\textrm{−33}}$, n = 167). Overall, DHA was more effective in improving the O3I (ΔO3I = 4.90 ± 1.33\%) compared to EPA (ΔO3I = 2.99 ± 1.19\%) in young Canadian adults who had a poor nutritional status with an O3I (3.50 ± 0.68\%) at baseline. Our method enables the rapid assessment of the O3I by directly measuring two circulating PC species in small volumes of blood, which may facilitate screening applications for population and precision health.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Biomarkers of food intake (BFIs) are a promising tool for limiting misclassification in nutrition research where more subjective dietary assessment instruments are used. They may also be used to assess compliance to dietary guidelines or to a dietary intervention. Biomarkers therefore hold promise for direct and objective measurement of food intake. However, the number of comprehensively validated biomarkers of food intake is limited to just a few. Many new candidate biomarkers emerge from metabolic profiling studies and from advances in food chemistry. Furthermore, candidate food intake biomarkers may also be identified based on extensive literature reviews such as described in the guidelines for Biomarker of Food Intake Reviews (BFIRev). To systematically and critically assess the validity of candidate biomarkers of food intake, it is necessary to outline and streamline an optimal and reproducible validation process. A consensus-based procedure was used to provide and evaluate a set of the most important criteria for systematic validation of BFIs. As a result, a validation procedure was developed including eight criteria, plausibility, dose-response, time-response, robustness, reliability, stability, analytical performance, and inter-laboratory reproducibility. The validation has a dual purpose: (1) to estimate the current level of validation of candidate biomarkers of food intake based on an objective and systematic approach and (2) to pinpoint which additional studies are needed to provide full validation of each candidate biomarker of food intake. This position paper on biomarker of food intake validation outlines the second step of the BFIRev procedure but may also be used as such for validation of new candidate biomarkers identified, e.g., in food metabolomic studies.},

Altogether 59 subjects (aged 19–32 yr, body mass index 16.8–31.3 kg/m2) were randomized into the following diet groups: (i) control group; (ii) fish diet group eating fish meals five times per week [0.38±0.04 g eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 0.67±0.09 g DHA per day]; (iii) DHA oil group taking algae-derived DHA oil capsules (1.68 g/d DHA oil group taking algae-derived DHA oil capsules (1.68 g/d DHA in triglyceride form); and (iv) fish oil group (1.33 g EPA and 0.95 g DHA/d as free fatty acids) for 14 wk. The fatty acid composition of plasma lipids, platelets, and erythrocyte membranes was analyzed by gas chromatography. The subjects kept 4-d food records four times during the study to estimate the intake of nutrients. In the fish diet, in DHA oil, and in fish oil groups, the amounts of n-3 fatty acids increased and those of n-6 fatty acids decreased significantly in plasma lipid fractions and in platelets and erythrocyte membranes. A positive relationship was shown between the total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and EPA and DHA intake and the increase in total n-3 PUFA and EPA and DHA in all lipid fractions analyzed. DHA was preferentially incorporated into phospholipid (PL) and triglyceride (TG) and there was very little uptake in cholesterol ester (CE), while EPA was preferentially incorporated into PL and CE. The proportion of EPA in plasma lipids and platelets and erythrocyte membranes increased also by DHA supplementation, and the proportion of linoleic acid increased in platelets and erythrocyte membranes in the DHA oil group as well. These results suggest retroconversion of DHA to EPA and that DHA also interferes with linoleic acid metabolism.},

	abstract = {Urine has long been a “favored” biofluid among metabolomics researchers. It is sterile, easy-to-obtain in large volumes, largely free from interfering proteins or lipids and chemically complex. However, this chemical complexity has also made urine a particularly difficult substrate to fully understand. As a biological waste material, urine typically contains metabolic breakdown products from a wide range of foods, drinks, drugs, environmental contaminants, endogenous waste metabolites and bacterial by-products. Many of these compounds are poorly characterized and poorly understood. In an effort to improve our understanding of this biofluid we have undertaken a comprehensive, quantitative, metabolome-wide characterization of human urine. This involved both computer-aided literature mining and comprehensive, quantitative experimental assessment/validation. The experimental portion employed NMR spectroscopy, gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), direct flow injection mass spectrometry (DFI/LC-MS/MS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) experiments performed on multiple human urine samples. This multi-platform metabolomic analysis allowed us to identify 445 and quantify 378 unique urine metabolites or metabolite species. The different analytical platforms were able to identify (quantify) a total of: 209 (209) by NMR, 179 (85) by GC-MS, 127 (127) by DFI/LC-MS/MS, 40 (40) by ICP-MS and 10 (10) by HPLC. Our use of multiple metabolomics platforms and technologies allowed us to identify several previously unknown urine metabolites and to substantially enhance the level of metabolome coverage. It also allowed us to critically assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of different platforms or technologies. The literature review led to the identification and annotation of another 2206 urinary compounds and was used to help guide the subsequent experimental studies. An online database containing the complete set of 2651 confirmed human urine metabolite species, their structures (3079 in total), concentrations, related literature references and links to their known disease associations are freely available at http://www.urinemetabolome.ca.},

	abstract = {Recently, metabolomics analyses have become increasingly common in the general scientific community as it is applied in several researches relating to diseases diagnosis. Identification and quantification of small molecules belonging to metabolism in biological systems have an important role in diagnosis of diseases. The combination of chromatography with mass spectrometry is used for the accurate and reproducible analysis of hundreds to thousands of metabolites in biological fluids or tissue samples. The number of metabolites that can be identified in biological fluids or tissue varies according to the gas (GC) or liquid (LC) chromatographic techniques used. The cover of these chromatographic techniques also differs from each other based on the metabolite group (polar, lipids, organic acid etc.). Consequently, some of the metabolites can only be analyzed using either GC or LC. However, more than one metabolite or metabolite group may be found altered in a particular disease. Thus, in order to find these alterations, metabolomics analyses that cover a wide range of metabolite groups are usually applied. In this regard, GC–MS and LC–MS techniques are mostly used together to identify completely all the altered metabolites during disease diagnosis. Using these combined techniques also allows identification of metabolite(s) with significantly altered phenotype. This review sheds light on metabolomics studies involving the simultaneous use of GC–MS and LC–MS. The review also discusses the coverage, sample preparation, data acquisition and data preprocessing for untargeted metabolomics studies. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of these methods were also evaluated. Finally, precautions and suggestions on how to perform metabolomics studies in an accurate, precise, complete and unbiased way were also outlined.},

Also, 20 serum metabolite concentrations were consistently measured by both methods over a 500-fold concentration range with an overall mean bias of 9.5\% ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 660). Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses independently confirmed that serum choline and histidine were consistently elevated ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.05) in HCV patients with late-stage (F2-F4) as compared to early-stage (F0-F1) liver fibrosis.

Both instrumental techniques enable rapid yet reliable quantification of serum metabolites in large-scale metabolomic studies with good overlap for biomarker replication. Advantages of MSI-CE-MS include greater metabolome coverage, lower operating costs, and smaller sample volume requirements, whereas NMR offers a robust platform supported by automated spectral and data processing software.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
