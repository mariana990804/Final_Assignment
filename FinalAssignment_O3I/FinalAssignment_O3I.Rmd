 The Omega-3 Index (O3I) reflects eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content in erythrocytes. While the O3I is associated with numerous health outcomes, its
 widespread use is limited. We investigated whether urinary metabolites could be used to non invasively monitor the O3I in an exploratory analysis of a previous placebo-controlled, parallel
 arm randomized clinical trial in males and females (n = 88) who consumed either ~3 g/d olive oil
 (OO; control), EPA, or DHA for 12 weeks. Fasted blood and first-void urine samples were collected
 at baseline and following supplementation, and they were analyzed via gas chromatography and
 multisegment injection–capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS), respectively. We
 tentatively identified S-carboxypropylcysteamine (CPCA) as a novel urinary biomarker reflecting O3I
 status, which increased following both EPA and DHA (p < 0.001), but not OO supplementation, and
 was positively correlated to the O3I (R = 0.30, p < 0.001). Additionally, an unknown dianion increased
 following DHA supplementation, but not EPA or OO. In ROC curve analyses, CPCA outperformed
 all other urinary metabolites in distinguishing both between OO and EPA or DHA supplementation
 groups (AUC >80.0%), whereas the unknown dianion performed best in discriminating OO from
 DHAalone (AUC=93.6%). Candidate urinary biomarkers of the O3I were identified that lay the
 foundation for a non-invasive assessment of omega-3 status.

# Introduction
 The omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-LCPUFA) eicosapentaenoic
 acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have recognized anti-inflammatory and
 triglyceride-lowering properties [@calderOmega3FattyAcids2010, @mozaffarianOmega3FattyAcids2011] and are associated with reductions in coronary heart
 disease mortality [@abdelhamidOmega3FattyAcids2018], neuropsychiatric disorders [@EmergingRoleOmega], and all-cause mortality [@harrisBloodN3Fatty2021]. EPA and
 DHA are primarily obtained through the consumption of fatty fish and other marine foods,
 but small amounts are also produced endogenously [@burdgeConversionAlinolenicAcid2002, @plourdeExtremelyLimitedSynthesis2007]. Due to the numerous health benefits associated with n3-LCPUFA, monitoring their levels in the population is important
 to help prevent and/or mitigate health risks.
 
The two most common methods to determine a person’s n3-LCPUFA status are through dietary assessment or through directly measuring their levels in the blood; however, both methods have recognized limitations. Self-reported assessments of food intake, such as food frequency questionnaires and diet records, are subject to reporting biases [@BiasDietaryreportInstruments, @poslusnaMisreportingEnergyMicronutrient2009] and are unable to account for individual differences in n3-LCPUFA digestion, absorption, and metabolism that ultimately affect their levels in the body. The current gold standard
 to determine a person’s n3-LCPUFA status is to directly measure EPA and DHA levels in erythrocytes using gas chromatography–flame ionization detection (GC-FID) or mass spectrometry [@Omega3IndexCardiovascular]. The sum of EPA and DHA in erythrocytes is commonly known as the Omega-3 Index (O3I). In contrast to fatty acids measured in serum, plasma, or whole
 blood, the O3I is less sensitive to acute dietary changes and was reported to reflect n3
LCPUFA membrane content in other tissues such as heart, liver, muscle, and kidney [@ComprehensiveReviewChemistry, @tuCorrelationsBloodTissue2013].
 Consequently, the O3I has been positioned as a modifiable and diet-sensitive biomarker
 that can be used to estimate cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and other health risks,
 where an O3I value of <4% corresponds to high risk and >8% corresponds to low risk [@harrisOmega3IndexNew2004].
 However, a major limitation with measuring the O3I is the need for a blood sample, which
 presents a challenge in many people due to needle phobia [@FearNeedlesSystematic, @mcmurtryExposurebasedInterventionsManagement2016], as well as the lack of a
 globally accepted standardized methodology for calculating the O3I [@dempseyInfluenceDietarySupplemental2023].
 
 To overcome the challenges associated with dietary assessments, blood sampling, and
 complicated sample workup procedures, researchers have begun to explore the use of urinary metabolites to objectively and non-invasively monitor an individual’s dietary intake
 and/or nutrient status [@rafiqNutritionalMetabolomicsClassification2021, @RoleMetabolomicsDetermination, @SchemeFlexibleClassification]. Several studies have proposed candidate urinary biomarkers related to fish intake, including acetylcarnitine, methylbutyrylcarnitine, propionylcarni
tine, and 3-methylhistidine [@UrinaryBiomarkersDietary]; however, these urinary metabolites remain to be independently validated and may not be specific to n3-LCPUFA. The O3I was recently reported to
 be inversely associated with the urinary albumin–creatinine ratio [@filipovicBloodOmega3Fatty2021] and 8-hydroxy-2
deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG; [@bigorniaOmega3IndexInversely2016]), while other studies have reported urinary metabolites
 that change following n3-LCPUFA supplementation, such as trimethylamine-N-oxide
 (TMAO)[@gibsonAssociationFishConsumption2020] and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid (CMPF) [@leeDocosahexaenoicAcidReduces2019]. How
ever, no study to date has investigated if urinary metabolites could serve as a biomarker
 for the O3I. As such, identifying and validating urinary metabolites that reflect an individual’s O3I could potentially lay the foundation for the development of a non-invasive biomonitoring strategy for precision nutrition.
 
 The present study is an exploratory secondary analysis of a previously reported
 randomized control trial in which the differential effects of high-dose EPA and DHA
 supplementation on the O3I and blood pressure regulation were investigated [@metherelCompoundspecificIsotopeAnalysis2019]. The
 current analysis aimed to identify and evaluate candidate urinary metabolites that can serve
 as non-invasive biomarkers of the O3I in a cohort of healthy young adults who consumed
 EPAor DHAsupplements for 12 weeks. We hypothesized that a small number of urinary
 metabolites would be responsive and specific to changes in n3-LCPUFA status such that
 they could perform reliably as a non-invasive biomarker of the O3I. An untargeted data
 workflow was used to characterize changes in the urine metabolome via multisegment
 injection–capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS) and identify novel
 biomarkers temporally associated with EPA and/or DHA intake.

# Materials and Methods

## Participants and Study Design

 Ninety healthy men and women aged 18–30 years were recruited from the University
 of Guelph (Guelph, Ontario, Canada) between January 2017 and June 2017. Exclusion
 criteria included smoking, history of cardiovascular disease, chronic use of pharmacological medications (except for oral contraceptives), >2 servings of fish or shellfish (or
 other EPA/DHAfortified foods) per week, and fish oil supplementation in the previous
 3 months. All participants provided written informed consent, and the study was approved  by the Research Ethics Board at the University of Guelph. The trial was registered at
 clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03378232).
 
 Eighty-eight participants completed the 12-week double-blind, parallel arm, randomized trial in which the effects of ~3 g/day olive oil (OO; control), EPA, or DHA supplementation were compared. Participants were randomized into one of 3 groups, (1) OO
 supplement, (2) EPA supplement, and (3) DHA supplement, with block randomization
 stratified by sex. Participants were instructed to maintain previous dietary and exercise
 habits for the duration of the trial and one day prior to blood and urine collection [@metherelCompoundspecificIsotopeAnalysis2019].
 Following an overnight fast, blood and first-void urine samples were collected before (base
line) and after the 12-week supplementation period and stored at 80 C until analysis.
 Participant characteristics, including age, height, and weight, were measured at baseline.

## Supplements

 Olive oil and purified EPA and DHA (KD-PUR DHA700TG) oil supplements were
 obtained from KD Pharma (Bexbach, Germany) and encapsulated using InnovaGel in
 identical softgel capsules. Fatty acid (FA) purity (mean SEM) was determined via gas
 chromatography and previously reported to be 75.7 0.1% for oleic acid (18:1n-9) in the
 olive oil supplement, 74.7 0.09% EPA and 0.55 0.01% DHA in the EPA oil supplement,
 and 72.3 1.3% DHA and 1.05 0.11% EPA in the DHA oil supplement[@folchSIMPLEMETHODISOLATION1957]. Quantitative
 fatty acid purity levels were also reported previously [@metherelCompoundspecificIsotopeAnalysis2019], with the OO capsules containing
 818 mg oleic acid and no detectable EPA or DHA, EPA capsules containing 813 mg EPA and
 7 mg DHA, and DHA capsules containing 814 mg DHA and 7.5 mg EPA. Supplementation
 of 4 capsules/d at these amounts corresponded to approximately 3 g/d of oleic acid,
 EPA, and DHA.Participants were instructed to take 2 capsules twice daily with food for
 12 weeks.
 
## Erythrocyte Fatty Acid Content

Blood samples were collected from the antecubital vein into EDTA-treated vacutainers to isolate erythrocytes. Samples were separated via centrifugation at 700 g at 4 C
 for 15 min. Erythrocyte samples were shipped to the Medical University of Białystok,
 Poland, on dry ice for fatty acid composition analysis. Lipids were extracted according to
 the Folch method [@Omega3FattyAcid]. Briefly, lipids from isolated erythrocytes were extracted in chloro
form:methanol (2:1 vol:vol) containing butylated hydroxy-toluene (0.01%) as an antioxidant
 and heptadecanoic acid (17:0) as an internal standard, as previously described [@MetabolomicsRevealsElevated]. After
 lipid extraction and transmethylation with BF3/methanol, the lipid phase containing fatty
 acid methyl esters (FAMEs) was dissolved in hexane and analyzed using a Hewlett-Packard
 5890 Series II gas chromatograph with a Varian CP-SIL capillary column (100 m, internal
 diameter 0.25 mm) and flame-ionization detector. Individual fatty acids were detected in
 accordance with the retention times of standards. FAME and fatty acid standards were
 purchased from Larodan. A total of 15 FAs were measured: myristic acid (14:0), palmitic
 acid (16:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7), stearic acid (18:0), oleic acid (C18:1n-9), linoleic acid
 (18:2n-6), arachidic acid (20:0),-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3), behenic acid (22:0), di-homo--linolenic acid (20:3n-6), arachidonic acid (20:4n-6), lignoceric acid (24:0), EPA (20:5n-3),
 nervonic acid (24:1n-9), and DHA (22:6n-3). FAs were standardized to haemoglobin (Hb)
 and reported as relative (% FA composition) values or quantitative (ng FA/mg Hb) values.
 The O3I was calculated through summing the relative % of EPA and DHA.

## Erythrocyte Fatty Acid Content

### Chemicals
 All chemical standards and calibrants were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
 USA), including analytical grade ammonium acetate, ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium
 hydroxide, formic acid, organic acids, sodium hydroxide, and recovery/internal standards,
 including 4-aminobutyric acid-2,2,3,3,4,4-d6 (GABA-d6), choline-d9, 4-fluorophenylalanine
 (F-Phe), 3-chlorotyrosine (Cl-Tyr), 4-fluorotyrosine (F-Tyr) and naphthalene-2 sulfonic acid  (NMS). All LC-MS grade solvents, including acetonitrile, isopropanol, methanol, and water,
 were obtained from Caledon Laboratories Ltd. (Georgetown, ON, Canada). Calibrant
 solutions for all analytes were prepared through the serial dilution of stock solutions
 (50 mM) in LC-MS grade water and stored in a refrigerator (4 C).
 
### Preparation of Urine Samples and Quality Controls
 Briefly, all urine samples were slowly thawed on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 g
 for 5 min. Subsequently, 20 L of urine was aliquoted into a centrifuge tube and diluted
 five-fold with 60 L deionized water, and a 20 L mixture of internal standard (200 M
 Cl-Tyr and NMS) and recovery standards (200 M GABA-d6, choline-d9, F-Phe, F-Tyr), for
 a total volume of 100 L. Centrifuge tubes were vortexed for 5 s; then, 20 L was aliquoted
 into a polypropylene vial, and each sample was analyzed in duplicate. Quality controls
 (QCs) were made to represent the average of all combined samples, to be used to assess
 instrument drift from run to run. Pooled QCs were prepared through aliquoting 2 L from
 each individual sample into a centrifuge tube to establish a representative average sample.
 Then, a 20 Laliquot was diluted five-fold with 40 L deionized water, and 40 L internal
 and recovery standard mixture. This QC sample was analyzed in every analytical run
 via MSI-CE-MS in randomized sample injection positions during data acquisition for the
 evaluation of technical precision for each urinary metabolite that satisfied our selection
 criteria (CV < 30% with detection frequency >60%) using a high-throughput MSI-CE-MS
 metabolomics platform and standardized data workflow for biomarker discovery [@yamamotoMetabolomicsRevealsElevated2019].
 Three subgroups of QC samples were also prepared through aliquoting separately from
 the control, EPA, and DHA supplement arms, which were used for nontargeted metabolite
 profiling in conjunction with a blank sample. All diluted urine samples were stored at
 80 Cprior to analysis.

### Urine Metabolome Analysis
AnAgilent 6230B time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source equipped to an Agilent G7100A capillary electrophoresis (CE) unit was
 used for all experiments (Agilent Technologies Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada). An Agilent
 1260 Infinity isocratic pump and a 1260 Infinity degasser were applied to deliver sheath
 liquid. A sheath liquid composition of 0.1% vol formic acid in (60:40 methanol:water) and
 (70:30 methanol:water) at a flow rate of 10 L/min were used for positive and negative
 ion mode, respectively. For real-time mass correction, purine (20 L) and hexakis(2,2,3,3
tetrafluoropropoxy)phosphazine (HP-921, 20 L) reference ions were spiked into the sheath
 liquid (400 L) at 0.02% vol to provide constant mass signals. The nebulizer spray was set
 off during the serial sample injection before being switched on at 4 psi (27.6 kPa) following
 voltage application. The source temperature was set to 300 C, and drying gas was delivered at 4 L/min. The instrument was operated under a 2 GHz extended dynamic range for
 positive and negative modes of detection. The Vcap, fragmentor, skimmer, and octupole RF
 voltage were set to 3500 V, 120 V, 65 V, and 750 V, respectively. Separations were performed
 on bare fused-silica capillaries with a 50 m internal diameter, a 360 m outer diameter,
 and a total length of 135 cm (Polymicro Technologies Inc., Phoenix, AZ, USA). A capillary
 window maker (MicroSolv, Leland, NC, USA) was used to remove 7 mm of the polyimide
 coating on both ends of the capillary. All diluted urine and pooled QC samples were
 analyzed via MSI-CE-MS under two different configurations with full data acquisition.
 Sub-group analysis was also performed via MSI-CE-MS on pooled urine samples from
 different sub-groups of participants. An acidic background electrolyte (BGE, 1.0 M formic
 acid with 15% vol acetonitrile, pH 1.8) was used for resolving cationic metabolites under
 positive ion mode while an alkaline BGE (50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, adjusted
 with ammoniumhydroxide) was used for anionic metabolites under negative ion mode,
 as described elsewhere [@yamamotoUrinaryMetabolitesEnable2021, @macedoSweatMetabolomeScreenPositive2017]. Diluted urine samples were introduced hydrodynamically
 at 100 mbar (10 kPa), alternating between 5 s for each sample plug and 75 s for each
 BGEspacer plug, which was electrokinetically injected at 30 kV. In total, thirteen discrete samples were analyzed within a single analytical run of 45 min. The applied voltage was
 set to 30 kV at 25 C for CE separations together with a gradient pressure of 2 mbar/min.
 The structural elucidation of urinary metabolites associated with the O3I was performed
 via collision-induced dissociation experiments at an optimum collision energy when using
 a single-injection format in CE coupled to a 6550 quadrupole–time of flight–mass spectrometer system (Agilent Technologies Inc.) under positive or negative ion modes [@wishartHMDB50Human2022]. The
 structural elucidation of unknown metabolites associated with the O3I was also supported
 with accurate mass database searches for putative candidate ions reported in the Human
 Metabolome Database (HMDB 5.0) [@wangCFMID40Web2022], as well as predicted MS/MS spectra generated in
 silico via CFM-ID 4.0 [@dibattistaTemporalSignalPattern2017].

### Comprehensive Analysis of Ionic Urinary Metabolites with Quality Control
 A targeted and non-targeted data workflow was applied for characterizing urinary
 metabolites from spurious signals and background ions when using temporal signal pattern
 recognition with multiplexed separations in MSI-CE-MS [@saoiMetabolicPerturbationsStep2019]. An iterative approach
 was used to authenticate urinary metabolites primarily as their intact molecular ions (i.e.,
 [M+H]+ or[M H] )while filtering out signal redundancy, such as in-source fragments,
 isotopic contributions, and adducts. Briefly, a sub-group analysis was first performed
 when using a dilution trend filter comprising 13 independent serial sample injections via
 MSI-CE-MS under positive and negative ion mode [@pluskalMZmine2Modular2010], including a quadruple injection
 of a pooled urine sample comprised of all individuals in the study at both time points
 together with a single blank sample. An open-source software for data pre-processing of
 metabolomic data sets, MZmine (version 2.53) [@kassambaraPracticalGuidePrincipal2017], was used for reviewing, annotating,
 and selecting molecular features based on their characteristic accurate mass (m/z) and
 relative migration time (RMT) detected under positive (p) or negative (n) ion modes. Also,
 an in-house urinary metabolite library was used for targeted analysis, where each urinary
 metabolite was processed using vendor specific software (Agilent MassHunter Qualitative
 Analysis, version 10.0). The integration of all urinary molecular features was normalized to
 an internal standard (Cl-Tyr or NMS under positive and negative ion mode, respectively)
 and reported as their relative peak area (RPA). Temporal signal pattern recognition when
 using multiplexed separations in MSI-CE-MS was used to reject spurious, background,
 and redundant (i.e., in-source fragments, isotopic signals, salt adducts, and same ion
 measured in both modes) molecular features when analyzing urine samples pooled from
 OO, EPA, and DHA sub-groups. Overall, 125 urinary metabolites satisfied the following
 inclusion criteria: (1) detected with adequate frequency (>60%) and technical precision
 (coefficient of variance, CV < 30%) after a repeat analysis of 33 QC runs comprised of
 pooled urine from all participants, and (2) detected with adequate frequency (>75%) in
 participant data measured at both time points (n = 176). This filtering approach resulted in a
 urine metabolome data matrix that excluded infrequently detected exogenous compounds
 (e.g., acetaminophen glucuronide, saccharin, etc.). Additionally, recovery standards were
 excluded from the urine metabolome data matrix (except F-Phe). Otherwise, urinary
 metabolites not detected in certain samples were replaced with half the value of the
 minimum response measured across the entire cohort if present below method detection
 limits, whereas putative missing data due to potential isobaric interferences were excluded
 from analysis. Lastly, the integrated response ratio for each metabolite to an internal
 standard or RPA was normalized to creatinine for each respective participant to correct for
 hydration status when relying on spot morning urine samples. Overall, urinary metabolites
 associated with the O3I were identified with high confidence (level 1) when spiked with
 authentic standards (if available), tentatively identified based on the annotation of MS/MS
 spectra with a consistent electrophoretic mobility (level 2), or were unidentified with an
 unknown chemical structure (level 3) if ion responses were too low to acquire MS/MS
 spectra without a suitable candidate reported in the HMDB. In all cases, urinary metabolites
 were annotated based on their characteristic accurate mass and relative migration time
(m/z:RMT) under positive (p) or negative (n) ion mode together with their most likely
 molecular formula.
 
## Statistical Analysis

All statistical analyses were conducted in R(v4.1.2)[@MixOmicsPackageOmics] with RStudio (v2022.7.2.576)[@alboukadelRstatixPipeFriendlyFramework2019]. Rscripts are available upon request.

### Multivariate Analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the delta values of FAs, the
 O3I, and urine metabolites to compare the effect of OO, EPA, and DHA supplementation
 using the base-R stats function ‘princomp’ and ‘prcomp’ for fatty acid and metabolite data,
 respectively. Scaled PCA visualization plots were created with the package ‘factoextra’ (v
 1.0.7) [@pinheiroNlmeLinearNonlinear2011]. Partial least square–discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was performed on metabo
lite variable delta values with the ‘mixOmics’ package (v 6.16.3) [@grollVariableSelectionGeneralized2014], where overall and
 balanced error rates (BER) were plotted to determine the optimal number of components
 for the final model. Sparse partial least square–discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) was used
 to select for metabolites that responded to OO, EPA, or DHA supplementation.
 
### ANOVA Tests

Data normality and homogeneity of variance were assessed with the base-R Shapiro
Wilk test and Levene’s test from the ‘rstatix’ package (v 0.7.0.999) [@PROCOpensourcePackage], respectively. For
 normal and non-normal data distributions, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or
 Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to compare supplement groups at baseline, respectively. To
 determine the effects of EPA and DHA supplementation over time, creatinine-normalized
 urinary metabolite data were log10-transformed to establish normal distribution, and a
 linear mixed effects model (LMM) with random effects was fitted for each participant
 (‘nlme’ R package, v 3.1.157) [@villanuevaGgplot2ElegantGraphics2019] prior to two-factor, repeated-measures ANOVA analysis
 (‘stats’ R package, v 4.1.2). For metabolites with a significant group time interaction
 effect (Pint < 0.05), a Bonferroni control was applied to within-factor post hoc pairwise
 t-tests using the ‘rstatix’ and ‘emmeans’ packages (v 1.4.8) [@weiPackageCorrplotVisualization2017]. For urinary metabolites
 not normally distributed after log10 transformation, a one-way Kruskal–Wallis test was
 performed at both time points followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons using Dunn’s
 test with Bonferroni adjustment (‘rstatix’ package). For all post hoc pairwise comparisons,
 p-adjusted values are reported. All analyses on erythrocyte FAs were conducted on relative
 %data; however, when possible, we also investigated quantitative (ng FA/mg Hb) data to
 confirm our findings.
 
### Integrated Data

 Erythrocyte FA and urine metabolome datasets were integrated in a single dataset,
 with urinary metabolites as covariates and the O3I as the response variable. Isobaric
 or highly colinear urinary metabolites were removed prior to feature selection. Urinary
 metabolites in the integrated dataset were scaled from 0 to 10 to match the range in the O3I
 (the outcome variable). Feature selection was performed with a regularized LMM to select
 for relevant metabolites while including a random effect for participant. The LMM was
 implemented with the R package ‘glmmLasso’ (v 1.6.2) [@PsychProceduresPersonality2017] with an L1 penalty. The tuning
 parameter lambda ( ) was selected through a grid search over a given range of values
 from 2000 to 0.0001, where the value with the lowest Bayesian information criterion (BIC)
 was selected for the final fitted model. All remaining metabolites in the final model with
 non-zero coefficients and p < 0.05 were identified. As a confirmation, feature selection was
 also conducted on a second integrated dataset with urine metabolites as covariates, but
 this time using quantitative EPA + DHA (ng FA/mg Hb) as the response variable, which
 was scaled from 0–700 to match the EPA + DHA (ng FA/mg Hb) range in the dataset. The
 diagnostic ability of selected creatinine-normalized urinary metabolites and their ratios
 were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with the R package ‘pROC’ (v 1.18.0) [@klingelEPADHAHave2019], where optimal thresholds were selected via optimality criterion
 max(sensitivities + specificities), i.e., Youden’s J statistic.
 
# Results and discussion

## Patient Characteristics

A total of 90 participants were enrolled into the study, where 30 (15 males and 15 
females) were randomly allocated to each supplement group (See Figure \ref{fig:fig1}
. Two participants did not provide final blood and urine samples, one in the EPA supplement group and one in the OO control group, the former of which did not provide all baseline samples/measurements. In total, data for 88 participants with matching blood and urine samples at both time points were used for the present analysis.

## Identification of Urinary Metabolites Associated with EPA and/or DHA Supplementation

To avoid spurious results, we applied multiple statistical methods to identify urinary
 metabolites associated with the O3I. These urinary metabolites comprised 17 (out of 125)
annotated unknown ions via high-resolution MS tentatively identified using collision
induced dissociation MS/MS. First, we used supervised and unsupervised
 clustering methods to obtain a general overview of the urine metabolome data variance
 that distinguishes the supplement groups from one another. Second, we used pairwise
 analyses to examine changes in creatinine-normalized metabolite responses in relation to
 supplementation and time. Finally, we investigated those urinary metabolites that directly
 contributed to predicting variability in the O3I. Collectively, these complimentary statistical  approaches were used to select and identify urinary metabolites that were consistently and  temporally associated with n3-LCPUFA status as compared to the OO control.

## Distinguishing Supplementation Groups with Unsupervised and Supervised Clustering Approaches

First, we performed a global analysis to examine if urinary metabolite profiles could distinguish between the three supplement groups from baseline. Overall, the technical variance for repeated analysis of 125 metabolites (including creatinine) in a pooled urine sample was acceptable with a median CV = 13.4% for QCs (n = 33) as compared to their greater between-subject biological variance with a median CV = 60.5% (n = 178). Two-dimensional PCA plots of 124 creatinine-normalized urinary metabolites at both baseline (Figure  \ref{fig:fig2}) and 12 weeks were unable to distinguish the three supplement groups from one another. Furthermore, a PCA plot corresponding to the delta response values (i.e., RPA after supplementation – RPA at baseline) for urinary metabolites was also unable to distinguish the three supplement groups, with the first two components (PC1 and PC2) only explaining 20.4% of the total variance in the dataset. Similarly, the three supplement groups were not well distinguished by relative %FA or by quantitative FA data. In all instances, participants from all groups were clustered around the centre of each plot with no clear distinction observed between groups. We next performed supervised PLS-DA and sparse PLS-DA (sPLS-DA) to better distinguish the three supplementation groups in this study (Figure  \ref{fig:fig2}). While less total variation was explained by the first two principal components (i.e., PC1 + PC2 = 14% and 9% for Figure 2a, b, respectively) than in the PCA model, the visual separation between groups was slightly improved. Since we hypothesized that only a small subset of urinary metabolites would relate to changes in EPA and/or DHA erythrocyte content, we next performed a sPLS-DA for urinary metabolite biomarker selection.

Variable selection via sPLS-DA identified the top-ranked 15 urinary metabolites associated with OO, EPA, and DHA supplementation for both PC1 and PC2 (Figure  \ref{fig:fig2}). The metabolites selected in PC1 were related to DHA supplementation (blue), whereas those selected in PC2 largely corresponded to metabolites related to EPA supplementation (green). The top-ranked urinary metabolites having the largest weighting on PC1 were an unknown divalent anion (221.075:0.927:n), as well as an unknown cation (164.074:0.614:p) that was tentatively identified as S-carboxypropylcysteamine (CPCA) based on annotation of their slower positive mobility (at pH 1.8) due to a more acidic alpha-carboxylic acid moiety, resulting in their longer apparent migration times (e.g., S-propylcysteine). Overall, urinary CPCA was measured consistently with acceptable technical precision (CV = 9.8%, n = 33) throughout the study. The third and fourth most significant urinary metabolites classified via sPLS-DA along PC1 were tetrahydroaldosterone glucuronide and an unknown anion isomer (241.120:0.653:n), which was tentatively identified as a dipeptide when using MS/MS in negative ion mode, namely pyroglutamylisoleucine (pGlu-Ile) (Figure  \ref{fig:fig4}). As there were two partially resolved isobars in the extracted ion electropherogram with analogous MS/MS spectra, isobars were distinguished by their apparent migration times, with the slower migrating isomer likely being pyroglutamylleucine (pGlu-Leu). Overall, the urinary metabolites contributing the most loading weight for PC1 (Figure S2a) were an unknown dianion (221.075:0.927:n), CPCA (164.074:0.613:p), tetrahydroaldosterone glucuronide, and pGlu-Ile. Top loading weights for PC2 (Figure S2b) corresponded to choline, glucuronic acid, an unknown dianion (88.004:1.622:n), and quinic acid. Structural elucidation of the unknown dianion (221.075:0.927:n) was not feasible due to its low abundance in urine that prevented the acquisition of an MS/MS spectra. Its MS/MS spectrum at an optimal collisional energy under positive ion mode (Figure  \ref{fig:fig3}) together with its co-migration after spiking a standard of CPCA in pooled urine. Other isobaric candidate ions having the same molecular formula (e.g., ethione, N-methylmethionine, S-methylmethionine, etc.) were excluded as likely candidates based.

## Increases in Urinary CPCA Are Associated with n3-LCPUFA Erythrocyte Content

Finally, we performed additional analyses on the two lead urinary biomarkers of the O3I (CPCA and the unknown dianion 221.075:0.927:n) that were systematically identified in all three statistical approaches. Specifically, we examined whether the changes observed in these urinary metabolites were specific to changes in the O3I through measuring Pearson correlation coefficients ® with all other measured erythrocyte fatty acids (Figure  \ref{fig:fig4}). Urinary CPCA was positively correlated with the O3I (r = 0.30, p < 0.001) but also showed correlations with both EPA (r = 0.19, p = 0.012) and DHA (r = 0.21, p = 0.004) individually. CPCA was also inversely correlated with AA (r = 0.30, p < 0.001) and myristic acid (r = 0.26, p < 0.001). However, CPCA was not correlated with any other measured fatty acid. The unknown dianion (221.075:0.927:n) was more strongly correlated with the O3I (r = 0.47, p < 0.001) and with DHA (r = 0.53, p < 0.001) but was not correlated with EPA.

# Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate urinary metabolites
 as putative non-invasive biomarkers of the O3I using a non-targeted metabolomics ap
proach. Our results identified urinary CPCA and an unknown dianion (221.075:0.927:n) as
 novel candidate urinary biomarkers for O3I status in healthy, young individuals. While
 the unknown dianion (221.075:0.927:n) was also identified as an indicator of DHA sup
plementation specifically, CPCA was found to be associated with both EPA and DHA
 supplementation as compared to O [@flockDeterminantsErythrocyteOmega32013]. More specifically, both candidate urinary metabo
lites were positively associated with the O3I, and when compared to all 15 measured
 erythrocyte membrane-derived phospholipid fatty acids, creatinine-normalized urinary
 CPCAlevels showed specificity in their association with the O3I, whereas the unknown
 dianion (221.075:0.927:n) showed a greater association with DHA [@potischmanBiologicMethodologicIssues2003]. As a supplement group
 classifier between EPA or DHA relative to OO, urinary CPCA consistently outperformed
 other selected urinary metabolites when using ROC curves (AUC > 80%), whereas the
 unknowndianion showed the highest performance specifically for DHA (AUC > 90%) with
 poor sensitivity for EPA. Similarly, both CPCA (AUC = 73%) and the unknown dianion
 (AUC=89%)outperformed other urinary metabolites when classifying a low (<4%) versus
 high (>8%) O3I [@lyLipidomicStudiesReveal2023]. Taken together, our robust analyses have positioned urinary CPCA and
 the unknown dianion (221.075:0.927:n) as novel surrogates for the O3I. Collectively, this
 work lays the foundation for developing a convenient and non-invasive approach to assess
 an individual’s n3-LCPUFA status [@dragstedValidationBiomarkersFood2018].
 
 Urinary biomarkers represent an attractive option for nutrient monitoring. Traditional
 dietary assessments estimate nutrient status, but are limited in their ability to accurately
 capture variation in food quality, intake, absorption, and metabolism [@vidgrenIncorporationN3Fatty1997]. Therefore,
 biomarkers have the advantage of more accurately indicating the amount of a nutrient
 available to tissues and organs. Current validated nutrient biomarkers of n3-LCPUFA
 status such as the O3I [@bouatraHumanUrineMetabolome2013] require a small blood sample. Recently, Ly et al. [@zekiIntegrationGCMS2020] reported
 two phosphatidylcholine species can serve as circulating surrogate biomarkers of the O3I
 directly in serum or plasma rather than hydrolyzed EPA and DHA measured from the
 phospholipid fraction of erythrocyte membranes. Yet, access to blood specimens may still
 represent a barrier to their use at both the individual and population levels. In contrast,
 the use of urinary metabolites as a proxy for the O3I could improve ease of monitoring
 while capturing physiologically relevant information. Although numerous reports in
 the literature have identified potential candidate biomarkers of n3-LCPUFA status, very
 few have been validated and are therefore currently of limited use. While a validation
 pipeline for biomarkers of food intake and/or nutrient status has been proposed [@dunnMetabolomicsCurrentAnalytical2005],
 meeting all criteria for establishing the biological validity and analytical performance of a
 biomarker remains a challenge. Nevertheless, the power of a validated urinary biomarker
 for nutrient status has wide-scale implications for use in personalized health, nutrition  and epidemiological research, and clinical risk assessment for cardiovascular events and
 hypertriglyceridemia, amongst others.
 
 Through our analyses, we found that urinary CPCA was significantly correlated
 with changes in the O3I and AA satisfying both a dose and temporal response as criteria.
 Moreover, urinary CPCA was reliably measured with acceptable technical precision (mean
 CV < 10%) with no missing values using a validated multiplexed separation platform
 and data workflow for metabolomics based on MSI-CE-MS. Also, urinary CPCA
 increased consistently following both EPA and DHA supplementation in our cohort of
 young Canadian adults having a low average O3I status at baseline. Overall, no other
 putative urinary biomarker associated with the O3I identified in our study had higher
 sensitivity (89.6% and 83.3%) and specificity (72.4% and 72.4%) for both EPA and DHA
 supplementation, respectively. We hypothesized that the inverse relationship between
 CPCA and AA stems primarily from the known reduction in AA membrane content
 observed with increased n3-LCPUFA intake. Indeed, we found that when the relative
 levels of erythrocyte EPA and DHA increased, there were proportional reductions in AA.
 In a dose–response randomized controlled trial examining EPA + DHA supplementation in
 healthy male and female participants, Flock et al. [@shanmuganathanCrossPlatformMetabolomicsComparison2021] reported that erythrocyte EPA and
 DHAcontent increased concomitant with comparable reductions in AA content. Similarly,
 Vidgren et al. [@shanmuganathanCrossPlatformMetabolomicsComparison2021] showed significant reductions in erythrocyte AA content in individuals
 consumingafishoilsupplementoreatingafishdiet. Ourfindingsalignwiththeseprevious
 studies. Due to the close relationship between n3-LCPUFA and AA erythrocyte membrane
 content, the specificity of CPCA related to the O3I may falsely implicate the latter. Indeed,
 there was an equivalent strength of association of urinary CPCA inversely with AA and
 positively with the O3I (r = 0.30) as compared to EPA or DHAalone. Nevertheless, increases
 in the O3I concomitant with decreases in AA are generally indicative of good health [56].
 
 Urinary metabolites related to fish intake have been proposed as potential urinary
 biomarkers in previous studies. In a cross-sectional analysis of the INTERMAP study,
 Gibson et al. [@mozaffarianOmega3FattyAcids2011] found TMAO and taurine were capable of distinguishing between low
 and high fish intake in a Japanese subpopulation. Our study identified and quantified
 urinary TMAO, but we did not find that this metabolite was capable of distinguishing
 betweenlowandhighO3Ilevels. Takentogether, thissuggests that TMAOmaybeaurinary
 biomarker related to marine meat protein intake rather than n3-LCPUFA. A randomized
 controlled trial in individuals with type-2 diabetes supplemented with fish oil, flaxseed oil,
 or corn oil showed significant increases in urinary CMPF in the fish oil group, which was
 also highly correlated to serum CMPF [@abdelhamidOmega3FattyAcids2018]. The association of urinary CMPF could not be
 evaluated in our study as it was not detected via MSI-CE-MS. Therefore, both TMAO and
 CMPFrequire further evaluation to clarify their use as biomarkers of fish/fish oil intake
 versus n3-LCPUFA status.

 
 Currently, there are nine isobaric candidate metabolites in the HMDB that match the
 most likely molecular formula for the urinary metabolite we have tentatively identified
 as CPCA(164.074:0.613:p-C6H13NO2S). While the unambiguous identification of CPCA is
 ongoing, we have ruled out four isobaric ions based on migration behaviour and structural properties that impact their ionization state (i.e., pKa) and corresponding migration times.
 Of the remaining isobaric ion candidates reported in the HMDB, the structural properties of
 CPCA’s functional groups best reflect the migration time and characterization shown in the
 extracted ion electropherogram (Figure 3). Furthermore, additional studies are necessary
 to clarify the underlying biochemical link(s) between n3-LCPUFA and CPCA as well as
 establish reference intervals for urinary CPCA in larger populations to define optimal
 cut-off concentrations associated with the O3I.
 
 Additionally, while demonstrating astrongassociation to theO3I, anunknowndianion
 (221.075:0.927:n) showed specificity in its relationship to DHA supplementation with
 seemingly little-to-no association with EPA supplementation. In the absence of a confirmed
 identification for this urinary metabolite, it is challenging to speculate on the biochemical
 significance of this finding and its link with DHA; however, this currently unidentified
 metabolite may prove to be a specific marker of DHA in the body and thus warrants
 continued investigation. Improved concentration sensitivity is needed to measure this
 lower abundance hydrophilic urinary metabolite, which is also needed when acquiring
 better quality MS/MS spectra.
 
 Our study has several strengths. First, the participant samples used were collected
 during a randomized placebo-controlled trial that included matching baseline and 12-week
 fasted blood and first-void urine samples. Second, erythrocyte fatty acid measurements
 were examined using both relative % and quantitative (ng FA/mg Hb) values, thus al
lowing for the robust verification of the relationship between erythrocyte EPA and DHA
 with CPCA. All three statistical methods performed on all 124 creatinine-normalized
 urinary metabolites confirmed similar results, where CPCA and an unknown dianion
 (221.075:0.927:n) were consistently identified using several different approaches. Addi
tionally, we conducted an initial proof-of-principle study 2 years prior to the present full
 study that first identified a relationship between CPCA and high-dose DHA intake relative
 to OOwith goodmutual agreement and reproducibility, thus demonstrating the stability
 of CPCAinfrozen urine samples following repeat analysis after thawing and long-term
 storage. Finally, to rule out potential metabolite contamination, we analyzed both lipid
 and aqueous extracts of the OO, EPA, and DHA capsules and did not detect CPCA, the
 unknown dianion (221.075:0.927:n), and other polar/hydrophilic biomarker candidates
 reported in this work, reinforcing that the changes in concentration of these endogenous
 urinary metabolites reflect biochemical changes in study participants following high-dose
 EPAand/or DHAintake.
 
 There are also several limitations to our study. First, we acknowledge the small and
 relatively homogenous sample size of the current study. Indeed, participants were all
 young (18–30 y) and healthy individuals that do not necessarily reflect variation seen in
 free-living populations. Thus, the generalizability of urinary CPCA and the unknown
 dianion (221.075:0.927:n) as non-invasive biomarkers for the O3I needs to be confirmed
 in populations that vary in age, ethnicity, genetics, and health status. Additionally, other
 lifestyle factors were not accounted for during the clinical trial, such as physical activity,
 alcohol consumption, and dietary patterns. Future studies will need to measure macro- and
 micronutrient intakes to ensure that changes in urinary metabolites are specific to changes
 in n3-LCPUFA intake. Furthermore, first-void urine samples used in our metabolomics
 analyses are more susceptible to acute or diurnal changes in urine composition, which
 maydiminish the accuracy of associations drawn between urine metabolites and long-term
 changes in erythrocyte fatty acid composition. As such, 24 h urine samples and/or several
 repeat spot urine samples collected over time from the same individual could provide a
 more reliable metabolite assessment of O3I status and improve the strength of associations
 between urinary metabolites and erythrocyte fatty acid composition. Future work needs
 to explore the stability of these metabolites in urine through comparing fasting first-void
 urine samples with 24 h samples, as well as day-to-day variability. Moreover, urine samples
 were analyzed on a single metabolomic platform (MSI-CE-MS), which is well suited for
 identifying polar or ionic compounds since they are predominantly excreted in human  urine. However, due to the selectivity and sensitivity of liquid chromatography, gas
 chromatography, and CE-MS techniques to capture different types of compounds, the use
 of complementary instrumental platforms may uncover additional urinary biomarkers
 of the O3I [@shanmuganathanCrossPlatformMetabolomicsComparison2021, @dunnMetabolomicsCurrentAnalytical2005]. Ultimately, this could lead to the identification of a larger panel of
 urinary metabolites that may reflect changes in the O3I compared to CPCA and/or the
 unknown dianion (221.075:0.927:n) alone while also independently validating biomarker
 outcomes across platforms [@abdelhamidOmega3FattyAcids2018]. Furthermore, it is unclear what minimum dosage of n3
LCPUFA is needed to elicit a significant increase in these candidate urinary biomarkers
 above endogenous background levels in human urine. Since participants in the present
 trial received moderately high doses of EPA or DHA (~3 g per day), future studies should
 consider different doses and formulations of n3-LCPUFA supplementation. Finally, the
 underlying biochemical connection between these candidate urinary biomarkers and n3
LCPUFA remains to be elucidated.

# Conclusions

We report the identification of a novel panel of urinary metabolites as robust, non
invasive biomarkers of n3-LCPUFA status . Specifically, our findings reveal that urinary
 CPCAandanunknowndianion (221.075:0.927:n) may serve as promising biomarkers for
 the O3I, and thereby lay the groundwork for establishing an objective and non-invasive
 test for the personalized assessment of n3-LCPUFA status. We anticipate that an eventual
 non-invasive test could be used for early screening of health risks and self-monitoring of
 the O3I following personalized dietary changes. However, additional studies confirming
 the sensitivity and specificity of these urinary metabolites as biomarkers of the O3I require
 further validation prior to considering their clinical utility.
